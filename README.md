# Sahana-Eden at CNU

The Sahana Eden Repository for the CISE lab working on the project at CNU.

How this works
==============

So the way that this github repository works is by collabroating together, and always keeping up to date with certain issues, and work that eveyrone is doing.

On the left hand site of the page, there is an issues button. This button will come in handy when collaborating on the project. I think it is beneficial as well to update people on the IRC chat with certain issues you have. Any help from the Sahana-Eden community is good help, and it never hurts to get someone's opinion on how they might be modified.
